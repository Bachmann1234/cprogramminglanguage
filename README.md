My workspace for working though the book "The C Programming language"

I have not written much C and am working though the book. I do not promise any of the solutions I put in here are 100% correct. Mostly just dumping them here. If you see I can improve them feel free to file an issue or PR. But really I dont expect anyone to be reading this anywho....
